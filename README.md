### 🌍 Ghanaian-Bronxite | Cloud Network and Software Engineer | Open Source Enthusiast
Hello there! 👋 I'm John Asare, a passionate Cloud Network and Software Engineer with a love for open-source projects and a global perspective. 🌐 I was born in Ghana, but I grew up in the vibrant streets of the Bronx, NY. 🗽. As a kid, I was always in trouble for taking apart TV remotes, computers, light bulbs, and other electronic gadgets in the household. This curiosity character gene has motivated my success in the Information Technology world. I recently completed rigorous cloud certification courses, honing my cloud architecture, deployment, and optimization skills. Looking forward to joining your team 🤗.
